# Car Dealership Dashboard

This project was developed as the conclusion of the course taught by Midori Toyota on Udemy. I adapted some aspects of the queries and also utilized my knowledge in Looker Studio to create the dashboard, instead of creating it in Excel as originally done in the course. 

The first dashboard is a sales dashboard with key performance indicators and the main drivers of monthly results. It allows us to track revenue growth, number of leads, top selling brands and stores, and website visits per day of the week. This dashboard provides valuable insights into our business performance and helps us make data-driven decisions.

The second dashboard analyzes the key characteristics of leads visiting our e-commerce, helping us define our ideal customer profile (ICP). It provides demographic information such as gender, professional status, age range, and salary range. Additionally, it includes information about the products they are searching for, such as whether they are interested in new or used vehicles, the age of the vehicle, and the top-selling models. This dashboard enables us to gain insights into our target audience and tailor our marketing strategies accordingly.
